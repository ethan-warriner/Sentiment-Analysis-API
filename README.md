# Sentiment-Analysis

## **Comparative study of NLP neural network architectures in Sentiment Analysis.**

This project compares the performance of four neural network models: RNN, GRU, LSTM, and DistilBERT, on the task of binary sentiment classification. The goal is to evaluate their **accuracy, training time, and model complexity** on the same dataset and demonstrate the evolution of NLP architectures.

---

## Overview

This is a **comparative case study** of NLP models:

- **RNN:** Basic recurrent network for sequential text modeling.  
- **GRU:** Gated recurrent unit for more efficient memory retention.  
- **LSTM:** Handles long-term dependencies with memory gates.  
- **DistilBERT:** Pretrained transformer, captures context globally using attention.

We train each model on the **IMDb Movie Reviews dataset** (25,000 training and 25,000 test reviews) and compare their **performance metrics**.

## Dataset

**IMDb Movie Reviews** (50,000 labeled reviews):

- 25,000 positive reviews (balanced positive/negative)  
- 25,000 negative reviews (balanced positive/negative)  
- Reviews are preprocessed via tokenization, padding, and vocabulary building for recurrent models, and via HuggingFace tokenizer for DistilBERT.

## Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| RNN | Simple recurrent neural network for sequential text modeling. |
| LSTM | Long short-term memory; handles long-term dependencies. |
| GRU | Gated recurrent unit; faster and more efficient than LSTM. |
| DistilBERT | Transformer-based pretrained model; high accuracy and contextual understanding. |
